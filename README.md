A cover for the terminals of small SLA (sealed lead-acid) batteries which have "faston" terminals on one end, to protect against short circuits from casual contact with metal objects.

This design is not weatherproof, nor has it been designed or tested against impacts that might break the plastic.

# Usage

To hold the cover in place a thin, non-conductive strap is required.

1. Measure your battery and strap as specified in the comments.
2. Print the cover.
3. Wire the battery.
4. Fit the cover over the wires.
5. Thread the strap through the slots, under the wires, and around the battery.
